## Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of a machine-learning model.

1. Feature Transformation (Transforming the original features)
   - Dealing with Categorical Variables
     - One Hot Encoding
     - Label Encoding
   - Date Time Transformations
2. Feature Selection (Selecting the most useful features to train on)
3. Feature Extraction (combining existing features to produce more useful ones)
   - Principal Component Analysis
